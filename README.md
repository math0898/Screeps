# Screeps
In this repository is the code I use to play the game Screeps... Yes that means you can use this against me but I hope my code is good enough to not have major flaws. 
# Main
This is the center of the code which then branches out to the other file families such as economy, combat, and logic. 
# Logic
Here lies the logic for things like spawning and room memory.
# Economy
All creep AI pertaining to my economy. 
# Combat
All creep Ai pertaining to combat.
